### About VietSoul
------------------------

**VietSoul** is an *imaginary* Vietnamese restaurant that offers a wide rage of Vietnamese Cuisine from up North to down South of Vietnam featuring:

- Bun Bo Hue
- Pho
- Springrolls
- Banh Xeo
- etc...

Once you come to **VietSoul**, your eyes will open wide and so will your stomach, but the opposite for your wallet obviously.

### About VietSoul Web Page
--------------------------
**VietSoul Web Page** is my first real project while at BeCode, after re-consolidating knowlegde of `HTML`, `CSS`, and obtaining `Bootstrap` which is mainly used in this project. Furthermore, I personally use `SCSS` for better readability.

After completing this first project, I'm more confident than ever of my `HTML`, `CSS`, and `Bootstrap` skills, even though `Bootstrap` was just introduced to the class not long ago.
On the other hand, sometimes I find `Bootstrap` a little bit unconvenient when I want my components to be more customized, However; Considering the quick and responsive layouts that `Bootstrap` offers, it comes in handy in many cases.
And I also realized that to best use a framework or library, we must understand well enough at least the basis of the language on which that framework or library is written on.
